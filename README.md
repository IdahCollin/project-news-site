# News Site

Pre-course project for the Technigo Web Developer Bootcamp. The assignment was to create a responsive magazine/newspaper site using basic HTML and CSS. Following was to be included: header, big news section, a grid of cards with other news and hover effects.

## The problem

The project was a huge learning process for me. I turned to Google, chatGPT and the Technigo learning-material for help. All of them were helpful in the learning process.

Tools: 
HTML and CSS. Flex-box was used for the header and footer. CSS-grid for the news-section. For this first project I sketched used a pen and paper. As I was learning I did changes along the way.

With more time next step would be to improve the design further, work more on the responsiveness of the "head-news" image and add a different nav bar for mobile phone-users.
