# News Site

Building a classic magazine/newspaper site including: header, big news section, a grid of cards with other news and hover effects. Responsive design with specific views was to be included.

## The problem

HTML and CSS: Flex-box was used for the header and footer. CSS-grid for the news-section. 

With more time my next step would be to improve the design.

(Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?)

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
