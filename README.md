# News Site

Pre-course project for the Technigo Web Developer Bootcamp, fall 2023. The assignment was to create a magazine/newspaper site using basic HTML and CSS. Following was to be included: header, big news section, a grid of cards with other news and hover effects. Responsive design with specific views was to be included.

## The problem

HTML and CSS: Flex-box was used for the header and footer. CSS-grid for the news-section. 

I turned to Google, chatGPT and our learning-material for help. All of them was helpful in the learning process.

For this first project I sketched used a pen and paper. As I was learning I did changes along the way.

With more time my next step would be to improve the design and work more on the responsiveness of the image at the top. I would also add a different nav bar for mobile phone-users. I would also have used Figma.
